# 🍄 Mushroom Classification using Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning to classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous based on physical characteristics. It uses a dataset from Kaggle and includes exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle Mushroom Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prishasawhney/mushroom-dataset)
- 8 features (e.g., cap shape, stem width, season)
- Target: Edible (1) or Poisonous (0)

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- StandardScaler (Feature Scaling)
- One-Hot Encoding
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gradient Boosting
- Neural Networks

## 🧪 Model Performance
| Model                   | Accuracy |
|------------------------|----------|
| Random Forest Classifier | 99%      |
| Neural Network          | 98%      |
| Gradient Boosting       | 88%      |

## 🧾 What's Included
- Final project PDF presentation: `Final Project_Group 5.pdf`
- Visuals of EDA, class distribution, and model comparisons
